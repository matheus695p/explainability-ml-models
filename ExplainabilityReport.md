# Feature Importance Explanation
Passenger capacity is the most important feature in predicting flight prices, as it is directly related to the number of passengers that can be accommodated on the flight. This is important because the more passengers that can be accommodated, the higher the potential revenue for the flight. Engines is the second most important feature, as the number of engines installed on the aircraft affects the performance and efficiency of the aircraft, which in turn affects the cost of the flight. Crew is the third most important feature, as the size of the crew required to operate the aircraft affects the cost of the flight. D-check complete is the fourth most important feature, as it indicates whether a D-check maintenance procedure has been completed for the aircraft, which affects the cost of the flight. Review scores rating is the fifth most important feature, as it indicates the overall review or rating of the aircraft's performance or quality, which affects the cost of the flight. IATA approved is the sixth most important feature, as it indicates whether the aircraft is approved by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which affects the cost of the flight. Company rating is the seventh most important feature, as it indicates the overall rating or performance of the aircraft's manufacturing company

# Feature Importance Explanation
Passenger Capacity: Passenger capacity is the most important feature in the model, as it accounts for 50.768% of the model's prediction. This is because the number of passengers an aircraft can carry is a key factor in determining its value and performance.
Engines: Engines are the second most important feature in the model, accounting for 37.455% of the model's prediction. This is because the number of engines installed on an aircraft is a key factor in determining its performance and efficiency.
Crew: Crew is the third most important feature in the model, accounting for 5.212% of the model's prediction. This is because the size of the crew required to operate the aircraft is a key factor in determining its performance and efficiency.
D-Check Complete: D-Check Complete is the fourth most important feature in the model, accounting for 2.915% of the model's prediction. This is because the completion of a D-Check maintenance procedure is a key factor in determining the aircraft's safety and reliability.
Review Scores Rating: Review Scores Rating is the fifth most important feature in the model, accounting for 2.17% of the model's prediction. This is because the

**SHAP Values Explanation Prediction index 0 question1**
The SHAP values for the prediction of the aircraft's performance indicate that the passenger capacity (233.495) and the number of engines (299.433) have the highest positive influence on the prediction. This is likely due to the fact that the passenger capacity and the number of engines are two of the most important factors in determining the performance of an aircraft. The crew size (12.029) and the IATA approval (-6.708) have a negative influence on the prediction, likely due to the fact that a larger crew size and IATA approval can be costly and may not be necessary for the aircraft's performance. The D-check completion (16.101) and the moon clearance completion (0.0) have a positive influence on the prediction, likely due to the fact that these procedures are important for ensuring the safety and reliability of the aircraft. The company rating (-10.089) and the review scores rating (0.733) have a negative and positive influence on the prediction, respectively, likely due to the fact that the company rating reflects the quality of the aircraft's manufacturing company, while the review scores rating reflects the overall performance or quality of the aircraft.
Prediction inference number 1 question1

Shap Values Explanation
The SHAP values for the prediction of the aircraft performance are as follows:
Base Value (positive influence on the prediction) = 2204.082
Engines (negative influence on the prediction) = -155.579
Passenger Capacity (positive influence on the prediction) = 293.645
Crew (negative influence on the prediction) = -12.029
D-Check Complete (positive influence on the prediction) = 16.101
Moon Clearance Complete (positive influence on the prediction) = 0.0
IATA Approved (negative influence on the prediction) = -6.708
Company Rating (positive influence on the prediction) = 1.933
Review Scores Rating (negative influence on the prediction) = -48.087
Prediction (positive influence on the prediction) = 2293.358
The SHAP values indicate that the most important variable in the prediction is the passenger capacity, which has a positive influence on the prediction. This is likely due to the fact that the passenger capacity of an aircraft is a key factor in determining its performance and overall quality. The second most important variable is the number of engines installed on the aircraft, which has a negative influence on
