# Feature Importance Explanation
Passenger Capacity: Passenger capacity is the most important feature in predicting flight prices, as it is directly related to the number of passengers that can be accommodated on the flight. This is important because the more passengers that can be accommodated, the higher the potential revenue for the flight.
Engines: The number of engines installed on the aircraft is also an important factor in predicting flight prices. The more engines an aircraft has, the more powerful it is, and the faster it can fly. This is important because faster flights can be more expensive, as they can cover more distance in a shorter amount of time.
Crew: The size of the crew required to operate the aircraft is also an important factor in predicting flight prices. The larger the crew, the more expensive the flight will be, as more personnel will need to be paid for their services.
D-Check Complete: A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether a D-check maintenance procedure has been completed for the aircraft is also an important factor in predicting flight prices. A D-check is a comprehensive maintenance procedure that is required to be completed on an aircraft every few years. If the aircraft has not had a D-check completed,
