## Feature Importance Explanation
**Passenger Capacity**: Passenger capacity is the most important feature in predicting flight prices, as it is directly related to the number of passengers that can be accommodated on the flight. This is important because the more passengers that can be accommodated, the higher the potential revenue for the flight.
**Engines**: The number of engines installed on the aircraft is also an important factor in predicting flight prices. The more engines an aircraft has, the more powerful it is, and the faster it can fly. This means that the aircraft can cover more distance in a shorter amount of time, which can lead to lower flight prices.
**Crew**: The size of the crew required to operate the aircraft is also an important factor in predicting flight prices. The larger the crew, the more expensive it is to operate the aircraft, which can lead to higher flight prices.
**D-Check Complete**: A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether a D-check maintenance procedure has been completed for the aircraft is also an important factor in predicting flight prices. A D-check is a comprehensive maintenance procedure that is required to be completed on an aircraft every few years. If the D-check has

## Feature Importance Explanation
**Passenger Capacity**: Passenger capacity is the most important feature in the model, accounting for 50.768% of the model's total feature importance. This is because the number of passengers an aircraft can carry is a key factor in determining its value and performance.
**Engines**: Engines are the second most important feature in the model, accounting for 37.455% of the model's total feature importance. This is because the number of engines installed on an aircraft is a key factor in determining its performance and efficiency.
**Crew**: Crew is the third most important feature in the model, accounting for 5.212% of the model's total feature importance. This is because the size of the crew required to operate the aircraft is a key factor in determining its performance and efficiency.
**D-Check Complete**: D-Check Complete is the fourth most important feature in the model, accounting for 2.915% of the model's total feature importance. This is because the completion of a D-Check maintenance procedure is a key factor in determining the aircraft's safety and reliability.
**Review Scores Rating**: Review Scores Rating is the fifth most important feature in the model,
